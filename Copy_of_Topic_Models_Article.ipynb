        "How can we extract meaning from the `review_body` though? There are many ways of course. Rather than going bottom up from simple techniques such as key words, n-grams, tf-idf etc., let's jump straight into the concept of embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "A key idea for machine learning is that of representations. Most algorithms can only work with numbers, so whatever we're dealing with - words, texts, images - we should represent with numbers. We are focusing on texts here, texts can represent many different things, so we also need many numbers - let's say 768 - for each text. We'll put these 768 numbers into vectors and use them to represent our texts. **These vectors are called embeddings**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purpose of these article, we will not worry about where these embeddings come from, other than the fact we can produce them with the SentenceTransformer library. We will load a pretrained model (Distilbert) and use it to encode our texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
        "\n",
        "768 numbers for each text is actually less meaningful to a normal person than a text, so how does this help? We can use some magic to reduce these 768 numbers to 2. These magic is called `t-SNE` and it's one of several dimensionality reduction techniques (for example `PCA` or `UMAP`). It tries to preserve the relative positions of points in a multidimensional space while mapping it to fewer dimensions. With 2 dimensions, we can actually plot these points (texts) on a chart! Let's do it!\n",
        "\n",
        "Oh, we have 20.000 texts, so our chart can get really cluttered... Let's take a 1000 texts sample and use it instead."

strong enough to run a small 120v vacuum cleaner, to clean car.\",\"The leg openings are a little small, but other than that the suit fits nicely, and is high quality material. Edit: I have been wearing this for less than two months and it is 100% worn out. It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it\\u2019s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.\",\"Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.\",\"Well it\\u2019s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that\\u2019s a lie it has 3 so that\\u2019s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it\\u2019s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better\",\"Very, very thin, you can bend them with you fingers with no problem! Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!\",\"Super cute! Loved it until I noticed that the casing around the purple rock was coming apart straight out of the package. SAD!\",\"Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3\\\" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.\",\"These bags have a lot of space in them, good thing about these bags is that I can easily see what's inside then. Very reasonable price.\",\"Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.\",\"Broke down after a month's use!!\",\"Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module\",\"Nice looks like picture\",\"Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it! Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!\",\"I\\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.\",\"Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.\",\"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.\",\"Buy this light.

This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it\\u2019s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either\",\"Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.\",\"Great prices and props for my photo booth company.\",\"I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn\\u2019t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow.

I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.\",\"When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this\",\"The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.\",\"unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!\",\"It's a fast charger but it doesn't charge the phone as fast as my plug in. It's nice but a fast cord charger is better.\",\"Perfect Christmas gift for my sister! She loved them. The bands are very difficult to change!\",\"The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it.

My cabinet looks like new.\",\"It\\u2019s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can\\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\\u2019m off my feet because I don\\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else\",\"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.\",\"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.\",\"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.\",\"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\",\"Did not charge my psp well at all\",\"Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.\",\"Have not used this because we cannot figure this out\",\"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!\",\"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced.

These are hard to put in & pull my hair when I take them out.\",\"A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.\",\"Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\\u2019s a Jeep and we\\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\\u2019t chipped, I\\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).\",\"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.\",\"Too big for my face. Look good & packages good!! Quick delivery!\",\"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!\",\"Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.\",\"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars\",\"From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.\",\"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.\",\"I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are.

They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly\",\"Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient\",\"My bird family that lives in our back yard loved this bird food.

You may need more of them than usual to create a laxative effect. But they are easy to eat straight from the package and absolutely fine with oatmeal or yogurt in the morning. I ordered them when my local grocery was out of prunes for some reason and was glad to be able to get these from Amazon.\",\"For some reason, I bought these to ride my bike with in the cold.

At the Derby party, I tried taking it off the headband and just clipping it to my hair, but it still was too heavy to stay in place and kept sliding down. It was uncomfortable, and I finally just had to take it off so it did not fall down into my mint julep. :)\",\"Nice pair of leggings. Very comfortable.

Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base.

I haven't placed it in the dishwasher so I can't say that it's dishwasher safe. It easier to use a bottle brush and clean it with soap and water. I love having two bottles.

The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the \\u201cneck\\u201d piece, the other didn\\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don\\u2019t screw them in as far, you\\u2019re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.\",\"Great quality for a reasonable price.

Very much worth trying!\",\"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..\",\"The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.\",\"Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged\",\"Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these.

Would purchase again.\",\"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)\",\"This is a very short movie, a kind of \\\"Who dunnit?\\\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)\",\"Yes yes yes!!!!

There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus.

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles.

So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.\",\"Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply.

Quality not the best as the tie began to rip on my second wear. Also it is more robe like as it only ties. Easy to fix with a safety pin.\",\"Out of 12 ornaments 6 were cracked. I guess the 6 functional ones are going to work well for what I need them for haven\\u2019t tried yet. Just opened package.\",\"Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.\",\"Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.\",\"for the price it didnt work very good so i sent it back\",\"The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!\",\"I bought this product for when I\\u2019m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.\",\"When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!\",\"I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.\",\"The calendar came damaged almost like a scratch on one of the dates. Not a huge deal but kind of a bummer since this wasn't exactly the cheapest calendar I could have purchased on amazon .\",\"Oh my gosh! I hot to see my grand niece in her little outfit yesterday and I think it is the cutest thing ever! The sizing was perfect and the colors, bright and cheery! Her momma loves it and she received many compliments on it. Well made and beautiful fabrics.\",\"My jar tasted like my grandfathers old milking barn smelled. I could not use this.\",\"Totally love this! Very pretty! I\\u2019ve seen these years ago and when I found this on Amazon I ordered right away!\",\"It was not what I wanted.\",\"Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.\",\"The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.\",\"I had new sod put in over the summer. I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!\",\"Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat. My dog is not allowed on the couch but just rubbing up against it and the static from this fabric attracts so much white fur. A fine cover, I\\u2019d say, for a house with no animals.\",\"My uncle loved the shirt i got it for him material is perfect and tank you seller\",\"It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.\",\"The shoe fits great but feels thin on the sole. But for the money, it's great. Guessing pro soccer players wouldn't be using this but for what I need it for, it works.\",\"I don\\u2019t think this got very hot and felt very heavy.\",\"This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.\",\"This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.\",\"..fine to use for light snacks\",\"The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside. My son tried to use his rake to move some dirt around in our raised bed garden and it bent where the tool meets the stake - eventually breaking completely after that. The pieces are fairly flimsy and it is pretty small even for my 2 year old.\",\"Dominos didn\\u2019t fit in the slots. Had to return.\",\"This part arrived today not very happy by the quality of this product it\\u2019s made very cheap for the price. Will probably be corroded in about 2weeks. I expect to be changing this part very soon\",\"The material is thin and transparent. The threading is already loose prior to wear. They are comfortable otherwise.\",\"Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone\",\"Replacing previous pair that lasted two years and would\\u2019ve lasted longer if hubby didn\\u2019t where them as slide on slippers at times. These are a good purchase. Heavy duty, made to last, keep feet dry. Comfortable too!\",\"Just felt lose like it was going to fall apart easily.\",\"said juicer / blender - there is no juicer component\",\"SO EASY! I love it! First time with hard floors and I just grab this and sweep up stuff - it works well and is lightweight.\",\"Very good read. Keep me entertained an wanting to come back for more. Vrry intriguing. Loved the storyline an Talon.\",\"I like the color of the bag but the look of the bag could be a little more stylish. Overall, the bag provides enough storage space for all the necessities.\",\"Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.\",\"Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.\",\"I bought this twice. And returned it twice. It arrived with the glass broken in multiple pieces. What's wrong with your shipping department, Amazon???? I'm not the only one who has returned this item because it arrived broken. Please learn how to properly wrap, mark and ship fragile glass. SO DISAPPOINTED!\",\"Does this camera have to be on a HD dvr\",\"Instructions were sometimes difficult to understand, but given it was our very first time trying a murder mystery it was fun. We will do again - hoping for better results now that we (somewhat) know what we\\u2019re doing.\",\"Remote stopped working already. Bought new batteries thinking that was the issue but just more money down the drain.\",\"These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I\\u2019m impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.\",\"Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.\",\"It\\u2019s nice but very disappointed on the way it was packaged, small box in a bigger box, no styrofoam packaging and came opened up in box just flopping around. Hope it works or I\\u2019ll be calling for a refund. Thank You!\",\"The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.\",\"Blackout curtains so much better than they used to be. These are a decent size and texture. Perfect length.\",\"There is only one and for the price you can find others online that cone with 2. Very disappointed since the photos show 2.\",\"It didn\\u2019t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn\\u2019t show in the picture\",\"These are well made, super cute & a great size\",\"I use this for hiking and open water swimming in mountain lakes. The product is well built. It is fairly heavy material. It is very important to have it fully inflated or it drags when you swim. That is why I am giving it three stars.\",\"Water these for my cat was disappointed when recived product had a hole in each side of thumb of glove\",\"It doesn't fit good with the phone, in does not stick in the sides\",\"Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.\",\"Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.\",\"Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere\",\"I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.\",\"Being my first product like this I didn\\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\\u2019s a decent toy.\",\"Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it. It was so aggravating I almost returned it for that alone. Never again Netgear\",\"This is an addictive, albeit (very) gory game. Frankly, I would not recommend this for teens. I would not recommend it to anyone with aggression issues or anyone from Germany. Contains some boob nudity.\",\"I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.\",\"love it but xl runs a little small... now eating no carbs lol\",\"Was looking for taller pieces with more weight. There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.\",\"Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.\",\"I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.\",\"The scent is more masculine. The product wasnt what I expected.\",\"Work great and good quality\",\"The hatch looked great, fit well and worked well initially. In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover. I had to purchase a metal hatch cover for $26 to replace it. Seller refused to replace it, 1 year warranty, I was 2 weeks outside that window when I emailed them. Run, don't walk from the product and the seller.\",\"Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....\",\"I lake every thing about this camera the colors very clear\",\"I love that this is a rapid charge for two different USB ports! It makes on the go charging a breeze for us! Just plug in your power cord's USB connection and boom you will be all charged up and ready to go before you get to your destination!\",\"Really helps eyeshadow stay on all day.\",\"The seller shipped fast and there was no problems with the order. However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.\",\"(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports. They break easily / are not at all durable. In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.\",\"I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket. The fact that it came from Pakistan makes it pointless to return, I'd probably have as much in shipping charges as I have in the jacket. I can only shake my head at this point !\",\"This is a beautiful product. however is not made for curly hair it pulls and gets tangled.\",\"Is it a strong as I thought it was going to be it's flavorful but lacks the strength in coffee flavor\",\"Very pretty..But you might want to get a larger size up..\",\"This is adorable and just what I was looking for \\u2026. a little girl's 4th birthday. The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \\u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \\u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.\",\"Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.\",\"I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better. The Royal cushion, which I also have, is $25 less and WAY more supportive/comfortable.\",\"This Bear is cute, but it said in the description that it was 20\\\". As you can see in my photo I attached, it is almost 12\\\". That is a huge difference to me.\",\"Did not hold up for even one month of play at our club. Fiberboard under attractive painting so did not withstand being left outside. Fell apart.\",\"Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.\",\"Smells good and keeps the bugs away\",\"I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.\",\"Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again\",\"I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \\\"indoor\\\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)\",\"Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.\",\"It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old\",\"Exceedingly fake-looking.\",\"Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.\",\"There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.\",\"The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids\",\"I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\",\"It\\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off\",\"Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt.

But they, for sure, look nice.\",\"This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item!

I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.\",\"The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.\",\"Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.\",\"Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.\",\"Great little square/marking tool.

This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding\",\"One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty\",\"brass fittings very thin\",\"This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.\",\"This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!\",\"For the price it\\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be.

The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).\",\"Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today.

That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \\u201cclean out\\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it!

strong enough to run a small 120v vacuum cleaner, to clean car.\",\"The leg openings are a little small, but other than that the suit fits nicely, and is high quality material. Edit: I have been wearing this for less than two months and it is 100% worn out. It has worn so thin in multiple spots that it\\u2019s no longer appropriate for wearing in public, I have to throw it away. This is unacceptable.\",\"Really cute mug. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit bigger.\",\"Well it\\u2019s looks and feels okay but it most certainly does not have 4 pockets that\\u2019s a lie it has 3 so that\\u2019s pretty messed up to say it has 4 when it\\u2019s only 3 the fabric is super stiff hopefully after washing it will be better\",\"Very, very thin, you can bend them with you fingers with no problem! Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!\",\"Super cute! Loved it until I noticed that the casing around the purple rock was coming apart straight out of the package. SAD!\",\"Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable. I'm 5'3\\\" and it covers me from head to calf. Definitely gets the job done in keeping you covered.\",\"These bags have a lot of space in them, good thing about these bags is that I can easily see what's inside then. Very reasonable price.\",\"Super cute and very sturdy set. Looks great on my desk.\",\"Broke down after a month's use!!\",\"Side buttons are now much harder to click, and camera cutout on the back is not a precise cut, there is about a mm of space left between the case and the camera module\",\"Nice looks like picture\",\"Bought this for my girlfriend, and she loved it! Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!\",\"I\\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.\",\"Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.\",\"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.\",\"Buy this light. For the price you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing.\",\"Elena Ferrante is a genius. These books transport you to Naples. One can't help but to fall in love with Elena and Lila.\",\"This was never received...\",\"Stitching came undone immediately. Already took tags off so couldn't return. Disappointed.\",\"Seems to be working for my older dog. The vet recommended this brand.\",\"The USB was configured incorrectly to fit into my 2016 Hyundai Sonata. When I turned it over so that the USB would connect, the audio connector was on the wrong side. Won't work at all!\",\"Have not received over a month ago I ordered this\",\"Only gave one because couldn\\u2019t leave no stars. This was the recommended case for the touch screen I got for the raspberry pi. With some drilling and creativity it can be made to work but it\\u2019s not an out of the box cover. No instructions either\",\"Love these. Bought a total of 4 now. Over time they seem not to stand up like they did brand new, but still like them. Easy to carry up and down stairs, durable, and fit more than a full load of laundry.\",\"Great prices and props for my photo booth company.\",\"I expected more for what I paid for this. The long part of the frame doesn\\u2019t sit even at the middle, so it appears to bow. The photo I included shows the top of the frame against the box, for straight edge reference. It does the job, and I needed to get this photo framed for a project I needed finished tomorrow. Next time I\\u2019ll get an assembled, wood or metal frame.\",\"Its perfect for my purpose, its lite weight is perfect, and so soft and warm. I stopped using an electric blanket because this one is so much more comfortable.\",\"When I received this book the first 68 pages were missing. Absolutely unacceptable for even a used book. Makes no sense why it would be shipped like this\",\"The color cartridge does not work. I have tried everything that I can think of and my printer will not accept the color cartridge. I have to put the old color cartridge back in the printer just to be able to use the black cartridge.\",\"unbreathable item, I though it is because of the size; so I decided to replace the item but the issue as a customer you must pay for the refound shipping which cost around 4 dollars and the item itself 9 dollar .. doesn't make any sense !!!!\",\"It's a fast charger but it doesn't charge the phone as fast as my plug in. It's nice but a fast cord charger is better.\",\"Perfect Christmas gift for my sister! She loved them. The bands are very difficult to change!\",\"The aspect ratio is so bad I could not watch it. I really wanted to. Why has this not been corrected? Something really out of whack.\",\"Some of the designs are hard to recognize.\",\"Sadly, the pages were alllllll but 3 riped from the book. I wanted to return it but I was involved in a car accident and was unable to. But I\\u2019m disappointed that it was sent out in that condition.\",\"Not very powerful. Noisy.\",\"Beautiful shoes but rhinestone fall off. Found two and replaced them with glue but have lost some permanently. Still like the shoes.\",\"Nice color. My cabinet looks like new.\",\"It\\u2019s very hard to get the handle to lock in you need somebody strong to help you. I can\\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\\u2019m off my feet because I don\\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else\",\"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.\",\"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.\",\"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.\",\"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\",\"Did not charge my psp well at all\",\"Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.\",\"Have not used this because we cannot figure this out\",\"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!\",\"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced. I checked the local Ace hardware store, thinking it would have to be cheaper, but the flapper on Amazon was actually three bucks cheaper.\",\"Easy to install and worked to pump fluid to my windshield.\",\"Stick well, peel easy and stay on the wall. Exactly what I was hoping for my nursery. We had painted the walls and no damage done.\",\"the hinge broke after one year - not even a year of heavy use.\",\"That's make me cough be better\",\"I have long, fine hair. These are hard to put in &amp; pull my hair when I take them out.\",\"A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.\",\"Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\\u2019s a Jeep and we\\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\\u2019t chipped, I\\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).\",\"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.\",\"Too big for my face. Look good &amp; packages good!! Quick delivery!\",\"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!\",\"Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.\",\"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting.

For Brazilian front and back, the front was ok I still had to go over with a razor and the back didn't really work I had to just shave. The hair grew back faster than usual Im guessing because I pretty much shaved (since the wax didn't remove the hairs). I have course curly hairs but Ive never had a wax not work. I've been waxing for a while and this has to be the worse wax. Ive paid less for waxes that work on all of my body parts leaving it smooth for weeks.

They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension.

However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..\",\"The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.\",\"Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged\",\"Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these.

Would purchase again.\",\"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings.

Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)\",\"This is a very short movie, a kind of \\\"Who dunnit?\\\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)\",\"Yes yes yes!!!!

There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus.

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles.

However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry.

I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \\\"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\\\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction.

The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.\",\"Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening.

The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera.

I'm still not used to it!!\",\"I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work.

I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days.

In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.\",\"This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small.

My family and I totally loved it!\",\"But definitely order 1 size large then most, very cheap fabric, but it\\u2019s being used for a costume so will do\",\"only for indoor application. if you have no lip on the inside, it has to go on the outside. the magnets dont stick tightly at all, big gaps especially corners where insects will come in. i do not recommend.\",\"Battery did not power up my watch .\",\"Works great for my Deebot!\",\"The only thing I didnt like was that the pointy part of the velcro is too thick and I'm constantly afraid it might poke my baby. I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.\",\"The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.\",\"Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.\",\"Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.\",\"Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2\\\" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5\\\" range instead of stopping at 3\\\". Still a handy tool though.\",\"OK, but crumbly and stale.\",\"Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since\",\"I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.\",\"I have an older mule that I use for riding 4 or 5 times a week and I love it. This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding\",\"One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty\",\"brass fittings very thin\",\"This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.\",\"This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!\",\"For the price it\\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider\",\"As promised...it works!\",\"A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.\",\"Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy. Buttons are flimsy and toy does not always react fast to the commands. The main positive is that the toy is sturdy.\",\"Too big for my Christmas tree... is good material but too big.\",\"Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.\",\"Works great in the bright florida sun.\",\"I love this case it fits perfect for my Mac Pro 15 inch, the cover is soft and the design is nice. Love that it comes with a screen protector, it does bubble up a bit\",\"It is easy to use &amp; it works. Have only used it once.\",\"Chipped wood when it arrived\",\"I have not burned my old chair yet. I\\u2019m sure the new chair it will fit &amp; look good.\",\"This kit is designed too small ,and the location is too high for the phone to place on ,I can see only half the screen.\",\"Dissapointing product\",\"Great idea and format, but lacks answers to exercises. The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).\",\"Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!\",\"I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade. You must be careful or you can nick or cut a pet easily. Probably a great tool for professionals or experienced groomers or if your pet stays fairly still when trimming.\",\"wait and see how it works this winter\",\"Perfect for what i needed it for ...\",\"Very inconsistent in connection.\",\"Received a completely plain white t shirt!\",\"very hard and uncomfortable.\",\"Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.\",\"I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.\",\"Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \\u201cclean out\\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!!

Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!\",\"I\\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.\",\"Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.\",\"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.\",\"Buy this light.

I can\\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\\u2019m off my feet because I don\\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else\",\"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.\",\"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.\",\"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.\",\"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\",\"Did not charge my psp well at all\",\"Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.\",\"Have not used this because we cannot figure this out\",\"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!\",\"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet. Identical to the original flapper it replaced.

These are hard to put in & pull my hair when I take them out.\",\"A very solid watch band. A little heavy, and a little hard to adjust the sizing, but a good band.\",\"Easy to install*. Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\\u2019s a Jeep and we\\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\\u2019t chipped, I\\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).\",\"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.\",\"Too big for my face. Look good & packages good!! Quick delivery!\",\"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!\",\"Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.\",\"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars\",\"From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.\",\"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality & printing on the shirt are GREAT.

They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working. Too bad they broke so quickly\",\"Buy a few days, come back to review after use, really good, absorb dust very quickly, inside have 2 bag to change wash, put on the table to use very convenient\",\"My bird family that lives in our back yard loved this bird food.

One chair had a washer for the \\u201cneck\\u201d piece, the other didn\\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture).

Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it.

However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic.

The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

I put a dryer sheet in hammock with bag. All good now. This was shipped UPS and they left package at another house.

We made 2 MORE holes on each band!!! (With the same distance between holes as original holes). These smart watches are meant to be kind of tight on your wrist, well not tight, but touching the skin all around, so it can feel the heartbeat, track your exercise, track your sleep at night, etc, so having them even a little loose is useless to me.\",\"These earrings are darling and so lightweight!

The vibration speeds are average. Overall decent by if u r just looking for a little tease\",\"I purchased these water bottles in 25oz green for travelling internationally. Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)\",\"This is a very short movie, a kind of \\\"Who dunnit?\\\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)\",\"Yes yes yes!!!!

Send this back ask for return nerver receive return back..very disappoint...\",\"This case is okay. I does protect my tablet. The body seems well made and not flimsy. There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus. The case fits my Fire HD 8 Tablet, but the inside 'frame' opening is off center, so one side of the tablet face is a bit covered and there isn't room inside the case to shift the table over.\",\"Love at first sight!

Plot less compelling. Ready for 2nd of the series\",\"I now own these in 4 different colors. I gave it 4 stars because on one of the shirts the stitching was a little loose but over all a good buy. They are long enough to wear with leggings and cover your back end. The colors are just like pics.\",\"Sizes are not accurate\",\"This item is only made of plastic. I have other ice packs that have a soft fabric on one side, eliminating the need to place a \\\"towel\\\" next to your skin, as instructed by this one. I wanted to return it, but was not allowed to.\",\"The clip of this starter is terrible and seems like the wrong size most of the time. The entire assembly has fallen apart several times as the tube threading below the battery also seems too loose.

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets. It was a quick read for me, but definitely not a reread.\",\"Had surgery recently and I learned some of the PT exercises.

If the cord was included I would have given one star more. Would have given 5 stars if everything was included and the horns were not cheap material.\",\"They are a bit loose. The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.\",\"Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.\",\"Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.\",\"Helped play in the steering wheel slightly. Adjusting the gears on the gear box worked much better to reduce play. Also bad wheel bearings can cause excessive play in the steering wheel.

Was still working till a friend borrowed it and drove off with it on the trunk only to be destroyed. A good friend would have replaced it. But good friends and good tire gauges are hard to find. So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.\",\"Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply.

Do not use this if you have any wrinkles because it will settle right in them and make you look older. I gave it 2 stars because the shade was great.

However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry.

However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing.

EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution.

The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened.

It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP. I really need it, too.\",\"The calendar came damaged almost like a scratch on one of the dates. Not a huge deal but kind of a bummer since this wasn't exactly the cheapest calendar I could have purchased on amazon .\",\"Oh my gosh! I hot to see my grand niece in her little outfit yesterday and I think it is the cutest thing ever! The sizing was perfect and the colors, bright and cheery! Her momma loves it and she received many compliments on it. Well made and beautiful fabrics.\",\"My jar tasted like my grandfathers old milking barn smelled. I could not use this.\",\"Totally love this! Very pretty! I\\u2019ve seen these years ago and when I found this on Amazon I ordered right away!\",\"It was not what I wanted.\",\"Well I really enjoyed this watch until last weekend in Moab. While sitting in the relaxing hot tub my watch screen went blank and the watch started to vibrate. I have tried multiple remedies. I believe it is no longer good.\",\"The case adds character and protection to my Switch and I love the whole design except the case for the joy-cons. The small pieces to hold the joy-con cases together are small and fragile. They broke off after a couple of months when I was trying to put it back on. I can no longer use the cases for joy-cons but still kept the case for the console on. Overall I like this case.\",\"I had new sod put in over the summer. I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!\",\"Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat. My dog is not allowed on the couch but just rubbing up against it and the static from this fabric attracts so much white fur. A fine cover, I\\u2019d say, for a house with no animals.\",\"My uncle loved the shirt i got it for him material is perfect and tank you seller\",\"It is perfect. Shipping was on time. No issues with it at all.\",\"The shoe fits great but feels thin on the sole. But for the money, it's great. Guessing pro soccer players wouldn't be using this but for what I need it for, it works.\",\"I don\\u2019t think this got very hot and felt very heavy.\",\"This is a really good option for a physical sunscreen because it has high, broad spectrum protection, and the white cast is not awful. In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.\",\"This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.\",\"..fine to use for light snacks\",\"The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside. My son tried to use his rake to move some dirt around in our raised bed garden and it bent where the tool meets the stake - eventually breaking completely after that. The pieces are fairly flimsy and it is pretty small even for my 2 year old.\",\"Dominos didn\\u2019t fit in the slots. Had to return.\",\"This part arrived today not very happy by the quality of this product it\\u2019s made very cheap for the price. Will probably be corroded in about 2weeks. I expect to be changing this part very soon\",\"The material is thin and transparent. The threading is already loose prior to wear. They are comfortable otherwise.\",\"Window shades keep falling off the window. Don't stick very well or at all. Trying to figure out in purchasing suction cups so shades can stay up. Waste of mone\",\"Replacing previous pair that lasted two years and would\\u2019ve lasted longer if hubby didn\\u2019t where them as slide on slippers at times. These are a good purchase. Heavy duty, made to last, keep feet dry. Comfortable too!\",\"Just felt lose like it was going to fall apart easily.\",\"said juicer / blender - there is no juicer component\",\"SO EASY! I love it! First time with hard floors and I just grab this and sweep up stuff - it works well and is lightweight.\",\"Very good read. Keep me entertained an wanting to come back for more. Vrry intriguing. Loved the storyline an Talon.\",\"I like the color of the bag but the look of the bag could be a little more stylish. Overall, the bag provides enough storage space for all the necessities.\",\"Not much to say here other than I'm a huge fan of Micron pens. I don't recommend you use alcohol markers over them, but if you are just inking a drawing, sketching, or using them with watercolors, it's great. I think I have 6 in various sizes, and this one is awesome for fine detail work or sketching.\",\"Like how easy it is to install batteries and to fill with salt and peppercorns. Grinds really well. Would recommend buying this product.\",\"I bought this twice. And returned it twice. It arrived with the glass broken in multiple pieces. What's wrong with your shipping department, Amazon???? I'm not the only one who has returned this item because it arrived broken. Please learn how to properly wrap, mark and ship fragile glass. SO DISAPPOINTED!\",\"Does this camera have to be on a HD dvr\",\"Instructions were sometimes difficult to understand, but given it was our very first time trying a murder mystery it was fun. We will do again - hoping for better results now that we (somewhat) know what we\\u2019re doing.\",\"Remote stopped working already. Bought new batteries thinking that was the issue but just more money down the drain.\",\"These are very nice, makes me feel like a real biker dude! HaHa. Anywho they fit my palms as expected but are to short in the fingers but that is a common problem for me so I then ordered the extra large to get the finger lengths correct. For about 30 bucks I\\u2019m impressed with the quality. Made in Pakistan.\",\"Great price. Screw holes slightly off but unnoticeable once it's on. It did come scratched so that may bother you. I figured it'll get scratched when playing anyway lol. Again you can't beat the price.\",\"It\\u2019s nice but very disappointed on the way it was packaged, small box in a bigger box, no styrofoam packaging and came opened up in box just flopping around. Hope it works or I\\u2019ll be calling for a refund. Thank You!\",\"The tea tastes good but I'm not sure if it helped my supply at all.\",\"Blackout curtains so much better than they used to be. These are a decent size and texture. Perfect length.\",\"There is only one and for the price you can find others online that cone with 2. Very disappointed since the photos show 2.\",\"It didn\\u2019t really show what it actually looks like it has blue zippers and blue clips on the straps which they didn\\u2019t show in the picture\",\"These are well made, super cute & a great size\",\"I use this for hiking and open water swimming in mountain lakes. The product is well built. It is fairly heavy material. It is very important to have it fully inflated or it drags when you swim. That is why I am giving it three stars.\",\"Water these for my cat was disappointed when recived product had a hole in each side of thumb of glove\",\"It doesn't fit good with the phone, in does not stick in the sides\",\"Bought this to decorate cookies. Without a lot of weight on it the thing just slides on the table instead of spinning. Very hard to turn. We have been spinning it quite a bit and think we see it loosening up a little. We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.\",\"Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.\",\"Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere\",\"I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.\",\"Being my first product like this I didn\\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\\u2019s a decent toy.\",\"Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it. It was so aggravating I almost returned it for that alone. Never again Netgear\",\"This is an addictive, albeit (very) gory game. Frankly, I would not recommend this for teens. I would not recommend it to anyone with aggression issues or anyone from Germany. Contains some boob nudity.\",\"I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.\",\"love it but xl runs a little small... now eating no carbs lol\",\"Was looking for taller pieces with more weight. There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.\",\"Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.\",\"I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.\",\"The scent is more masculine. The product wasnt what I expected.\",\"Work great and good quality\",\"The hatch looked great, fit well and worked well initially. In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover. I had to purchase a metal hatch cover for $26 to replace it. Seller refused to replace it, 1 year warranty, I was 2 weeks outside that window when I emailed them. Run, don't walk from the product and the seller.\",\"Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....\",\"I lake every thing about this camera the colors very clear\",\"I love that this is a rapid charge for two different USB ports! It makes on the go charging a breeze for us! Just plug in your power cord's USB connection and boom you will be all charged up and ready to go before you get to your destination!\",\"Really helps eyeshadow stay on all day.\",\"The seller shipped fast and there was no problems with the order. However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.\",\"(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports. They break easily / are not at all durable. In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.\",\"I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket. The fact that it came from Pakistan makes it pointless to return, I'd probably have as much in shipping charges as I have in the jacket. I can only shake my head at this point !\",\"This is a beautiful product. however is not made for curly hair it pulls and gets tangled.\",\"Is it a strong as I thought it was going to be it's flavorful but lacks the strength in coffee flavor\",\"Very pretty..But you might want to get a larger size up..\",\"This is adorable and just what I was looking for \\u2026. a little girl's 4th birthday. The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \\u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \\u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.\",\"Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.\",\"I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better. The Royal cushion, which I also have, is $25 less and WAY more supportive/comfortable.\",\"This Bear is cute, but it said in the description that it was 20\\\". As you can see in my photo I attached, it is almost 12\\\". That is a huge difference to me.\",\"Did not hold up for even one month of play at our club. Fiberboard under attractive painting so did not withstand being left outside. Fell apart.\",\"Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.\",\"Smells good and keeps the bugs away\",\"I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.\",\"Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again\",\"I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \\\"indoor\\\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)\",\"Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.\",\"It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old\",\"Exceedingly fake-looking.\",\"Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.\",\"There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.\",\"The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids\",\"I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\",\"It\\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off\",\"Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt.

I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.\",\"The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.\",\"Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.\",\"Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.\",\"Great little square/marking tool.

This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding\",\"One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty\",\"brass fittings very thin\",\"This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.\",\"This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!\",\"For the price it\\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider\",\"As promised...it works!\",\"A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.\",\"Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy.

The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).\",\"Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!\",\"I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade.

The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.\",\"Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \\u201cclean out\\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it!

Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!\",\"I\\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.\",\"Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.\",\"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.\",\"Buy this light.

I can\\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\\u2019m off my feet because I don\\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else\",\"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.\",\"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.\",\"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.\",\"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\",\"Did not charge my psp well at all\",\"Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.\",\"Have not used this because we cannot figure this out\",\"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!\",\"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet.

Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\\u2019s a Jeep and we\\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\\u2019t chipped, I\\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).\",\"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.\",\"Too big for my face. Look good &amp; packages good!! Quick delivery!\",\"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!\",\"Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.\",\"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars\",\"From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.\",\"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality &amp; printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.\",\"I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are.

They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all. On the up side my Grandsons LOVED them while they were working.

Perhaps they could create a petite size!\",\"Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark &amp; seem to be of cheaper quality\",\"I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop..

I got this and while putting it on my iPad it BROKE! Super cheap material and I so disappointed with the quality that I put the new and old screen covers in the trash! Don't waste your money as this will just disappoint you.\",\"Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.\",\"This is a great product; however, the powder doesn't blend completely.\",\"Ordered a tinted they shipped me a clear one\",\"I've had a Roomba. It died after several years of hard use. It worked on hard flooring and rugs. This eufy RoboVac is a piece of crap. I'll be returning it. It does not work on floors with rugs even thin low ones. It gets stuck constantly and can't get itself out of it. After this experience I'll buy another Roomba.\",\"The directions that came with the crib for assembly, were completely wrong. It was not as easy to put together as expected. Other than, the crib is great and is good for small spaces.\",\"I love the look and lightness of this wig!

Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.\",\"It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.\",\"Light weight, easy to place on your car for mounting your phone. Great for young adults\",\"Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.\",\"I've never used a knife sharpening stone so this was interesting. Sharpened my knives quite well. It has been hard to find something that works in sharpening my kitchen knives, this worked.\",\"so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can \\\"grab\\\" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally \\\"modified\\\" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty.

I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn\\u2019t think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I\\u2019m not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper!

It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!!

It is a plastic hand pump and it is difficult to pup enough air to make it full and then quickly remove the pump and insert the stopper. An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.\",\"It looks nice but it is only facial quality. The rubber tips bend very easily. The wood is cheap wood.

Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh.

I couldn\\u2019t find one locally so I ordered it from Amazon. Two days later, I called Tracfone back to finally activate my new phone and was informed that this new SIM card was still no good. This time around they offered to send me one free of charge. Now, it\\u2019s a week later and I have a phone I can\\u2019t use. Grrrr..... I can\\u2019t understand why Tracfone doesn\\u2019t ask you which network is compatible with you phone and send you the correct SIM card BEFORE shipping the phone.

Over time we have noticed a huge improvement in regularity and cramps. Very much worth trying!\",\"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else. Sorry turtle beach, but your xbox headsets are just way better..\",\"The foot part of the sock was too big for the size it was suppose to fit, washing did not help, cannot use them.\",\"Just received my packaged today the product looked like it was used and the box was damaged\",\"Having lost many earrings (especially in winter, when scarves and hats seem to pull them off) I am very pleased with these.

Would purchase again.\",\"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

I put a dryer sheet in hammock with bag. All good now. This was shipped UPS and they left package at another house.

The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings. I also didn't realize how challenging it would be to grab silver jewelry from a silver tray. Glass ring holders are easier for this reason.

I may consider trying it again and hoping the second one holds up a little better.\",\"120 Quart cooler is pretty big.

The quality is fairly decent, especially for the price! I would not expect very large people to be comfortable in these chairs, though. The arms do not fold up and the chairs are built for small/ average weight people.

If you aren't good at assembling furniture then do not buy this table set.\",\"Bought this as a gift and immediately gave it to my mom because we were so excited. Was I embarrassed.

Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)\",\"This is a very short movie, a kind of \\\"Who dunnit?\\\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)\",\"Yes yes yes!!!!

Send this back ask for return nerver receive return back..very disappoint...\",\"This case is okay. I does protect my tablet. The body seems well made and not flimsy. There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus. The case fits my Fire HD 8 Tablet, but the inside 'frame' opening is off center, so one side of the tablet face is a bit covered and there isn't room inside the case to shift the table over.\",\"Love at first sight!

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.\",\"Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles. It really helps with our portable mini washer which requires constant draining, spinning and refilling to wash and rinse clothes. It's easy to forget which stage the laundry is at, and the indicator saves us guessing.\",\"Seems like it will last a while, as long as it is used for the purpose to which it was designed.\",\"Helped play in the steering wheel slightly.

However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car.

I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction.

On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet.

In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen.

The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on).

Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating.

All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well.

However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else.

Would purchase again.\",\"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film.

She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The toe kept slipping off when she kicked around, so I'll have to make some alterations. Other than that, very nice colors.\",\"Much larger than I expected, and well-constructed. The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles.

Was still working till a friend borrowed it and drove off with it on the trunk only to be destroyed. A good friend would have replaced it. But good friends and good tire gauges are hard to find. So I bought this hoping technology could make a cheap long-lasting tool. I was wrong, batteries took a dump after a month and only two uses. Not like my gauge from the '80s which had a 25-year battery life(no kidding). I didn't like having to disassemble this unit to changes batteries because it's not a quick change like a TV remote. when it worked it worked fine.\",\"Loved these! Super sparkly and easy to apply.

However, whenever I use this brand, my family complains about the chicken not being tender and a bit dry.

However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \\\"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\\\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution.

The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened.

In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen.

We are also having to order some double sided suction cups to see if we can get it to stay in place. Of course that is going to double the costs but we are hoping it will work.\",\"Worked decent for the first month then started to loose suction and now has lost all suction power. Cheap product but figured it would last longer than this.\",\"Suck crap! Broke down very quickly after purchase. Wires come out of nowhere\",\"I received it fast. But due to issues including sharpness around a section of its perimeter, I've initiated a return. Not sure if an exchange would have solved the issue. That being said, it may work for others.\",\"Being my first product like this I didn\\u2019t know what to expect. All in all it\\u2019s a decent toy.\",\"Signal was terrible. I think the 2.4g channel is only using one of the 3 antenna. logging into the device is a horror with netgear making you register online and every single login it wants you to upgrade to a pay service and they almost force you into it. It was so aggravating I almost returned it for that alone. Never again Netgear\",\"This is an addictive, albeit (very) gory game. Frankly, I would not recommend this for teens. I would not recommend it to anyone with aggression issues or anyone from Germany. Contains some boob nudity.\",\"I do not like them for the shoes I bought them to go with, but the are perfect for dress shoes.\",\"love it but xl runs a little small... now eating no carbs lol\",\"Was looking for taller pieces with more weight. There's pieces are for small boards. I play speed chess pieces fall over easy.\",\"Very disappointed, when I opened the Amazon box the creamers in the bag were broken. Amazon doesn't offer refund or exchanges on this item. Guess I'm taking a loss on this one. The product itself is great when it doesn't arrive damaged.\",\"I'm not sure if I can rate this product. While it smells great and softens the hair it does not boost color.\",\"The scent is more masculine. The product wasnt what I expected.\",\"Work great and good quality\",\"The hatch looked great, fit well and worked well initially. In the Arizona sun the plastic cover was completely rotted out in less than one year, not just cracked but in 40 pieces on the ground! No UV stabilizers in the cover. I had to purchase a metal hatch cover for $26 to replace it. Seller refused to replace it, 1 year warranty, I was 2 weeks outside that window when I emailed them. Run, don't walk from the product and the seller.\",\"Looked nice but fell off after 2-3 weeks.....\",\"I lake every thing about this camera the colors very clear\",\"I love that this is a rapid charge for two different USB ports! It makes on the go charging a breeze for us! Just plug in your power cord's USB connection and boom you will be all charged up and ready to go before you get to your destination!\",\"Really helps eyeshadow stay on all day.\",\"The seller shipped fast and there was no problems with the order. However, the item itself is just OKAY. The sound is not very loud, the day vision is good but the night vision DOES NOT WORK. I would not recommend this product, especially for the price.\",\"(See attached image) The supports have these little metal spacers inside the sections of the supports. They break easily / are not at all durable. In the image that leftmost piece used to be secured into the rightmost piece of the support before the little mater spacers pictured next to them fell out / broke. The spacers are not properly secured. Very low quality. Disappointing.\",\"I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this jacket. The fact that it came from Pakistan makes it pointless to return, I'd probably have as much in shipping charges as I have in the jacket. I can only shake my head at this point !\",\"This is a beautiful product. however is not made for curly hair it pulls and gets tangled.\",\"Is it a strong as I thought it was going to be it's flavorful but lacks the strength in coffee flavor\",\"Very pretty..But you might want to get a larger size up..\",\"This is adorable and just what I was looking for \\u2026. a little girl's 4th birthday. The first one I received had some very rough edging at the bottom on one side. This was sharp and would cause the child's hair to become tangled in it making it difficult to take on and off. Running my finger over it and it was actually sharp. I reported this to Amazon and they gladly shipped another,. The 2nd one was worse than the first. One side wasn't 'finished' properly \\u2026. appeared the silver color was worn or about to flake. It was rough when I ran my finger over it. AND--- the same sharp little protrusion at the bottom which I know will get caught in the hair. I know these are inexpensive little tiaras, but I want the child to enjoy it \\u2026. without it getting caught in her hair. . I am going to order a different style., Maybe I will have better luck.\",\"Color and texture of the cover are great. Unfortunately there isn't enough memory foam and the foam they use compresses down a ton. If you lay on it your likely to lay flat and your butt touches the floor. The picture they show is a total fallacy. Definitely can't sit on it with any support. Other memory foam brands do a lot better.\",\"I was expecting more comfort for this price. I'm 275lb but still have no padding on my rear. I've tried it flipped both ways (there's a dense side and a sparse side) and neither way felt that much better. The Royal cushion, which I also have, is $25 less and WAY more supportive/comfortable.\",\"This Bear is cute, but it said in the description that it was 20\\\". As you can see in my photo I attached, it is almost 12\\\". That is a huge difference to me.\",\"Did not hold up for even one month of play at our club. Fiberboard under attractive painting so did not withstand being left outside. Fell apart.\",\"Does not smell like Xmas wreaths, too weak.\",\"Smells good and keeps the bugs away\",\"I finally found the item I had misplaced and realized that they had send bands instead of this product.. Too late to return.\",\"Forget party favors, every single one was broken into three or more pieces. Will not buy again\",\"I had no idea what protection to buy, so I chose these. First time I used these was today at a indoor range. Really startled that it really didn't do to much to protect my ears. I cringed everytime my neighbor shot his 40 cal. Even my 9mm was a tad louder than it should have been. Now I need to buy \\\"indoor\\\" protection. Also found their manual confusing. It comes in 27 languages, and they give you this confusing image. (See my uploaded picture.)\",\"Great standard tape dispenser. I do wish it would come with an extra plastic core just in case one gets lost.\",\"It's not for baby's! This would for a 3 year old\",\"Exceedingly fake-looking.\",\"Compact, robust stainless steel shell and easy to manipulate shape. Performance is as rated. Quickly transfers using USB 3.0 interfaces. I use it as a boot drive for pfSense. Unfortunately, the flash drive runs very warm, hot actually. Uncomfortable to hold! This gives concern to its reliability in the long term. Be sure to have adequate ventilation. If used as an internal USB boot drive, it's recommended to have it in some form of air flow pathway within the chassis.\",\"There seems to be a short where the cord goes in to the light. If the light doesn't come on, push the cord into the socket and wiggle it up and down to get the light to come on. Even so will order another one for the living room.\",\"The colors are really hard and not wary to cover areas.. more like for kids\",\"I wasn't impressed. The back casing is very flimsy and the front cover is even worse. It doesn't snap on therefore when you hang it, it falls off and the cars fall out. We had to secure it with doublesided tape which makes it difficult to remove if you want to change cars out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\",\"It\\u2019s not magnetized as advertised. I have to be be careful how hard I pull it bc the adhesive is weak and it pops off\",\"Not half as big as the picture shows. I waited 2 days hoping it would fluff up, but it hasnt. Way too much money for the size it is. It looks flat.\",\"Exactly what I wanted! I have 3 cams outside. They are under sheds, so cannot talk about how weatherproof they are. But they, for sure, look nice.\",\"This tray has saved me so much time. I left some solid frozen ground beef on it to defrost while I go do other things, and I was shocked at how fast the beef defrosted. The time was essentially halved. Great item! My family and I totally loved it!\",\"But definitely order 1 size large then most, very cheap fabric, but it\\u2019s being used for a costume so will do\",\"only for indoor application. if you have no lip on the inside, it has to go on the outside. the magnets dont stick tightly at all, big gaps especially corners where insects will come in. i do not recommend.\",\"Battery did not power up my watch .\",\"Works great for my Deebot!\",\"The only thing I didnt like was that the pointy part of the velcro is too thick and I'm constantly afraid it might poke my baby. I just make sure to bring it down on her and don't leave it on her unattended. Other than that it's good. I use it to clean her up all the time. They're like little towels.\",\"The letters received do not spell what is pictured! Huge disappointment. The male strippers were a cute touch to the bachelorette party still.\",\"Writing extremely simplistic, heroine hard to like, mystery silly and boring all around.\",\"Snaps to hold the top on vac, is cheaply made and breaks easy. The hose slips off all the time from the vac, so over all shop vac has improved the vac to stainless steel but went backwards on everything else, which makes it worse than the plastic models.\",\"Great little square/marking tool. I wish it was just a 1/2\\\" loner. I find I would use it more often if it fell in the 3.5\\\" range instead of stopping at 3\\\". Still a handy tool though.\",\"OK, but crumbly and stale.\",\"Must make sure using the right charger thought was issue with battery until I switched chargers and has worked good since\",\"I liked it i used it on a combi lift at work.\",\"I have an older mule that I use for riding 4 or 5 times a week and I love it. This product is a classic case of the new version made far worse. It has fewer pockets and doesn't have a lined holder for your cell phone. I guess if you had never seen the older version you might like this but I would look elsewhere for something more utilitarian and better quality. I'm now using the bladder from this pack in my old pack since this one does not meet my needs for riding\",\"One of the two roller bottles I ordered came empty\",\"brass fittings very thin\",\"This item is cheaply made, and broke after only a few months. The truck comes off the light easily, as well. It's too bad, because it'd be a nice product, otherwise.\",\"This is a very classy table lamp. Compliments my office desk perfectly. Well crafted and very sturdy. Highly recommend this lamp!\",\"For the price it\\u2019s a nice Duvet cover. I had hoped it would be a little softer but perhaps with more washings it will be. Also, I\\u2019m using it on a split king and it could be a little wider\",\"As promised...it works!\",\"A friend recommended this screen to me and after seeing his set up I purchased this screen. Very light easy to set up and just as easy to put away. I was worried that there would be creases in it even tho they say it\\u2019s foldable but there were none. The hooks and other accessories they provide make it really simple.\",\"Fun toy when it wants to work. It takes multiple tries for the remote to engage the toy. Buttons are flimsy and toy does not always react fast to the commands. The main positive is that the toy is sturdy.\",\"Too big for my Christmas tree... is good material but too big.\",\"Great headband! Comfy, and absorbs sweat so perfect for a hot yoga class.\",\"Works great in the bright florida sun.\",\"I love this case it fits perfect for my Mac Pro 15 inch, the cover is soft and the design is nice. Love that it comes with a screen protector, it does bubble up a bit\",\"It is easy to use & it works. Have only used it once.\",\"Chipped wood when it arrived\",\"I have not burned my old chair yet. I\\u2019m sure the new chair it will fit & look good.\",\"This kit is designed too small ,and the location is too high for the phone to place on ,I can see only half the screen.\",\"Dissapointing product\",\"Great idea and format, but lacks answers to exercises. The book consists of 40 exercises (hands) for the reader/student to work through, defining hand ranges for actions and one's own strategy. The problem is that there are no answers provided. Of course there is no single answer for any of the problems, but a baseline set of answers, for comparison if nothing else, is really needed here, imho. I believe that the intent is for the reader to join the author's online forum to compare and discuss solutions there (I hope the author will clarify, if I am wrong about that).\",\"Amazing! I needed these by a certain the date. The seller contacted me within hours, made the bows, and HAD to have sent them out same day because I got them today. I am so impressed with not only the level of service, but the bows are absolutely perfect! Great size for Daisies, who are little girls. Thank you so much for your beautiful, quick, affordable work!\",\"I am not a groomer and found it more difficult to use that just using a guard on a finer blade. You must be careful or you can nick or cut a pet easily. Probably a great tool for professionals or experienced groomers or if your pet stays fairly still when trimming.\",\"wait and see how it works this winter\",\"Perfect for what i needed it for ...\",\"Very inconsistent in connection.\",\"Received a completely plain white t shirt!\",\"very hard and uncomfortable.\",\"Would have liked directions. No clue how to attach loose strap and whether to use, when, and how.\",\"I hate to write a product review because the balls themselves were fine. The are smaller than the average ball pit balls( like the other people said ) but are as listed. My issue is my product did not arrive in time. After an hour on the phone with Amazon I was instructed to order another set, because they could not guarantee delivery of the late ones. I was told if the other balls arrived I could keep them and be refunded the money for my inconvenience. I have not been refunded my money. So my review is for service not the quality of the product itself.\",\"Prior to purchasing this product I read some reviews advising not to purchase this product but I figured I\\u2019d see for myself. That was a MISTAKE! This product worked great for the first 3 weeks but even after routine maintenance and cleaning I don\\u2019t believe this product is worth your money. This product does assist in cooling a smaller space when ran on cool and packed with ice or the cooler packs provided! You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \\u201cclean out\\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!\"],\"topic\":[\"25: phone thing years home stay friend find\",\"0: case small love feels design bit camera\",\"3: 2 3 5 stars 1 4 weeks\",\"3: 2 3 5

Print is small.. More of a decoration. Would give 1/2 star!\",\"Super cute! Loved it until I noticed that the casing around the purple rock was coming apart straight out of the package. SAD!\",\"Fairly thick material, so the poncho should be good for multiple uses. It's VERY large, so if you're small in size don't expect it to be fashionable.

Might need to be washed first because it does smell like plastic at first due to the packaging, but it's a great plush!\",\"I\\u2019m giving three stars overall because there is a design flaw. The legs do not firmly attach to the lower panel. I didn\\u2019t realize this and lifted the utility cart up, making the front two legs come up off the bottom panel, and one of the wheels fells off (more about that below), causing the cart to fall over. At the time I was trying to clean my large window AC, which was on top of the cart. The AC fell with the cart, hitting its side on concrete. It broke because of this flaw. About the wheels - I thought I had pounded them in well enough but I hadn\\u2019t. I immediately flipped the cart and smacked them in with a mallet. While that was my fault, the leg supports coming off so easily are a major flaw and something to be aware of while using it. Possibly you could drill holes through the base pedestals and the part of the legs that fit over them and stick a metal rod through both. Maybe super glue would work as well. I don\\u2019t know but I had to buy a new AC because of this fail.\",\"Looks beautiful in the case, but VERY light for darker complexions.. it's a subtle look for sure\",\"Item was not sealed and was missing parts\",\"There are things I like about these and things I don't. Pros: They take up very little space and make a lot of ice cubes. The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays. Cons: The ice cubes take forever to freeze. Since they are silicone and very flexible, it is hard to get the trays from the sink to the freezer without spilling (even with the lids on). I like them and will keep using them, but my husband really doesn't care for them.\",\"Our finance team was needing more calculator rolls and could not find any locally. Thank you for having them.\",\"It's hard to be critical of something so inexpensive, but I was not happy with the product. I needed to buy a beach ball for some physical therapy exercises. Many of the Amazon offerings were sold in a package of 12. I didn't need/want 12 beach balls so I purchased this one. Two major complaints: the nozzle to blow up is so short that it is difficult to inflate, and it starts to lose air within less than 30 minutes of inflating. Update: The nozzle just fell apart and I had to throw away. Well, at least I got 2 weeks of rotten use from it. I would recommend that Amazon drop this vendor.\",\"Buy this light.

I can\\u2019t get the handle down at all to put it in the car so The handle has to stay up. I\\u2019m almost 4 weeks in and it\\u2019s not as comfortable as it was in the beginning so the comfort level goes down really fast. Now I am 5 foot 3 1/2. For somebody taller this might be fine for comfort level but for anybody under my height you need to get a kid size. But the cushion also wears down fast under weight I am close to 200 pounds. Losing weight though I\\u2019m off my feet because I don\\u2019t wanna get any bigger! I am now five weeks into using this scooter and the handle has popped off three times. None of these scooters with this type of wheel or any good on anything but flooring In a house. I tried to use it on a brick paved sidewalk and almost fell face first. Also twigs and small rocks can stop you in your path and turn you over if you\\u2019re not careful. Luckily my balances OK so none of that happened but I came close to it more than a dozen times. Again this is for in-home use only but the handle falls off after a few weeks so I would maybe buy something else\",\"Very nice quality and incredibly soft. However, they are very thin so you need to fold them in order to wipe more easily, or you need to completely soak them in makeup removing product. It's fine, unless your product is a bit expensive and you only want to use a little, like me.\",\"Since I have just received this product, I haven't had time to know for sure how it will benefit me. So far, so good.\",\"Love them, but the volume is low. I can't hear them without speaker phone.\",\"Ordered 18 of these lights to replace aging halogen outdoor landscape lights. All arrived in proper working order. The color options are terrific, which is great for changing colors for various holidays. My only dissapointment is that the white option is not really white. Several other colors show up with the white setting. If you want true white as one of the color options, dont buy these (my reason for taking one star away from the rating). They have held up very well over the four months I've had them installed, and the remote for changing color of the lights is fantastic. Blue, green, and red colors are the most vivid, and the various shades of these colors provide some interesting options. Pinks, purple, and aqua/teal colors are some of the more interesting shades. Yellow and orange shades are ok as well. I do like these very much and would purchase again, but I am exploring some other lighting to add with these that would give me a true white color.\",\"Did not charge my psp well at all\",\"Fits great and has been very durable. I have dropped my phone numerous times and have had no damage to my phone.\",\"Have not used this because we cannot figure this out\",\"Taste is better, works better and cheaper than 5 hour energy!\",\"Perfect fit in my Kohler toilet.

Packaging was taped shut (like it was used), the paint on the shifter is marred (as if it was dropped). Other than the unfortunate scratches on the paint, they look very cool. Went ahead and installed it knowing that it\\u2019s a Jeep and we\\u2019re going to scratch them up anyway. If the paint wasn\\u2019t chipped, I\\u2019d give it 5 stars. *Install note: It is possible to remove the stock knob without destroying it. Just pop the lower chrome collar loose with a trim removal tool. Once that is free, the knob slides right off. (Same thing for the 4 Wheel transfer knob).\",\"We have been big fans of PackIt products, as they last with our baby needs and children needs. We also love that we can throw them right into the freezer and they collapse, not taking up much space. I don\\u2019t know if there was a change in the product design, but in under three weeks our is already breaking on the inside liner.\",\"Too big for my face. Look good &amp; packages good!! Quick delivery!\",\"It is fantastic! I bought similar lights from other websites, and they have poor quality. Although this one is more expensive than others, I think it is worthy. It is really a good decoration for dorm! I will probably buy one more to give my mother as a gift!\",\"Not the size I hoped for but that could be partly my fault. It did come in a very nice gift bag with the brand name on it but I just wish that it was a bead or two larger. Otherwise this is a great gift for someone with a petite wrist.\",\"I bought this bubble machine to entertain my grandson since he loves bubbles and has a lot of energy. I was a little taken aback by the flimsy packing box and when I opened it, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the toy itself. I don't know how long it will last, but for now it is working ok. My grandson actually had a different one that also didn't last and seemed like it was made a little better than this one, so, I don't hold out too much hope for it lasting. I will update my review as time passes. So now the frog bub ble machine has been used for a while, and the one thing that has been an issue is that it tends to not blow through all the holes for the bubbles. it is stll working though and that is a plus. I still give it 3 stars\",\"From 10 feet away people can see your eyes. Don't buy.\",\"I wear a size 18/20 woman's t-shirt, blouse, etc. Sometimes they call this a 1X . So I ordered a XXL to be sure it would fit. I could barely get this t-shirt over my head and on. Once it was on I could barely breath. The quality &amp; printing on the shirt are GREAT. If they let me return these I am going to order (4) XXXXL to replace them that's how impressed I was the quality.\",\"I suggest buying a size bigger than what you are.

They do not last long and this was my second set. The first ones I purchase broke almost immediately ..at least in time to be able to replace them. Now shortly after receiving the second set they too have broken. But when I checked to get them replaced the return date has passed. I am not happy with this item at all.

Sadly, the first windy day the tree broke off of the base. Specifically, the metal tore above all of the 4 spot welds holding the lower tree's part's metal tube to the base. I solved the problem by creating a new base using 18\\\" long 1/2\\\" black iron pipe to push inside the tree's metal tube, then attached that to a 1/2\\\" black iron pipe flange.

Not happy with it at all.\",\"I bought two chairs and was super excited to put them together. These are definitely cute and are nice quality. The directions are easy enough to follow and you can quickly put one of these together. Main pain points: two chairs- one had an extra screw, the other had two defective screws. One chair had a washer for the \\u201cneck\\u201d piece, the other didn\\u2019t. Biggest issue, whether you use a drill or screw driver, you will see the tips of the screws poke through the face of the animal (see picture). If you try to avoid this and don\\u2019t screw them in as far, you\\u2019re left with a wobbly chair. A disappointing finish to what could be a great piece.\",\"Great quality for a reasonable price.

Willa is a strong, fierce and loving girl, in the style of Robert Beatty's best-selling protagonist Serafina series, but with a world and storyline all her own.

I'd recommend this bag if you need something on the cheaper side but I'm not sure if just my bag is like this or if this is routine.\",\"Lasted a whopping two weeks before it ripped with minimal usage of my AirPods.

The appearance is beautiful and I love the color. But sadly the top is to big. I followed the sizing chart for around the bust size.

I really think I am missing something. My 12-year old had trouble staying on it as well. We left it next to the tent that night and must have gotten rain because in the morning the thing had water in it...actually inside the liner. Not able to get the water out...and worried about mold...it ended up in the trash. Pretty bummed. The idea is great if it had worked for us.\",\"So I thought I would be getting some type of a \\\"minty orange\\\" lifesaver....(I wonder why? Look at the name of them!!!) WHen I tried my first one....Nope...NO \\\"mint\\\"! It's more of a bright orange flavor....Don't get me wrong...it's good, and a nice \\\"bright\\\" flavor over \\\"Mint\\\"....but the description is a little misleading. (Wow....ask my 22 year old self if I would be reviewing LIFESAVERS later in life, and I would have finished my beer, then laughed at you!) I think these are good! Just not \\\"mints\\\" as they state....\",\"Slightly off white and loose\",\"Love this dress, I probably should order a smaller size since it is a bit loose in the top and very long on me.\",\"The waist is too high and the bottom too long. I could get away with it but I like my leggings to be be fitted. I might have them altered or I send them back. Not sure yet. Fabric is on the thin size but not see through. Expected for the price. I am 5.2 so I would recommend for taller people! It adjusts well to my size which I am small/medium legging size. Perhaps they could create a petite size!\",\"Order these 3 times.. the first 2 times the lighters were good but the 3rd time I got a different set of lighters that were hard to spark &amp; seem to be of cheaper quality\",\"I have been using these types of braces for years for Ms foot drop.. I was excited for a black color. The strap was over a foot long and had to be wrapped around twice and just slid off the back of my leg. Poorly designed.\",\"Needed to flash it to get it working with my NVR system (shinobi). Seems to be working now.\",\"Talk about a POS!! I ordered this to replace a broken cover on my iPad. I got this and while putting it on my iPad it BROKE! Super cheap material and I so disappointed with the quality that I put the new and old screen covers in the trash! Don't waste your money as this will just disappoint you.\",\"Not sure what the point of the book was. Learned almost nothing that I didn't know about the Donner party. The characters were truly ridiculous. The storytelling which started out ok, just became boring almost to the point of being tedious. The ending was just as dull and anti-climactic. I bought this based on Stephen King's review. His books are better than his reviews are.\",\"This is a great product; however, the powder doesn't blend completely.\",\"Ordered a tinted they shipped me a clear one\",\"I've had a Roomba. It died after several years of hard use. It worked on hard flooring and rugs. This eufy RoboVac is a piece of crap. I'll be returning it. It does not work on floors with rugs even thin low ones. It gets stuck constantly and can't get itself out of it. After this experience I'll buy another Roomba.\",\"The directions that came with the crib for assembly, were completely wrong. It was not as easy to put together as expected. Other than, the crib is great and is good for small spaces.\",\"I love the look and lightness of this wig! The only issue for me is that it does not come with combs or a front lace. However, I purchased a wig grip and it stays in place perfectly! Will buy again!\",\"Loved it soooo much I ordered another set!\",\"Worked great on the first bottles of shampoo &amp; conditioner, when I switched them to the new bottles 1 of them quit working.\",\"I have wavy hair and I thought this would enhance my waves. It did nothing actually and didn't tame the frizz at all. I'm highly disappointed.\",\"Meh. They cut out some noise, but don't make a great seal. Comfortable, though - made of soft silicone - and at least they don't fall out. They fit pretty tight in the carrying case, so that I usually have to pry them out with my pen knife.\",\"It looks good, but the problem with this, IMHO, is that the optional extenders are of equal width. They need to vary. It's just a smidge too wide for where I need it with both extenders, but a bit too small if I use only one of them. The screws, then, are extended to their maximum amount not allowing for tightening. The gate is purposely agape to adjust to the tightening of the tension screws. You tighten up until the door meets the latch. Right now, I have it fit sort of kitty-corner between the two walls which is not ideal as I can't keep it at the proper tension. I'm only using this for a front patio to keep the dog from running out which is working fine, otherwise, it's a bit disappointing and annoying.\",\"Light weight, easy to place on your car for mounting your phone. Great for young adults\",\"Dock is solid, clean, cheap, and easy to install. However, after looking around I would consider buying a different shell that is compact enough to fit in a travel case (This one is slightly too thick to fit in mine), or a larger one with more features. For example, I would have liked to use the spring-loaded cradle and the power LED from the original dock. When I get a second dock I will be looking for a shell that includes these features. However, I have no problems with this one and I use it all the time on my TV. When I take the switch to someone else's house I put the ac adapter and the dock with the switch in a larger bag.\",\"I've never used a knife sharpening stone so this was interesting. Sharpened my knives quite well. It has been hard to find something that works in sharpening my kitchen knives, this worked.\",\"so, this thing is like a big fat crochet hook designed to grab the inside lip of the jacuzzi ball and pull. Which would be great, except that it's ONE QUARTER INCH TOO SHORT. Maybe Kohler changed their design to make it deeper, or something, but this tool is next to USELESS for removing jets from my tub. Instead of the ball lip, all you can \\\"grab\\\" is the sloped ledge inside the ball, which with a LOT of persistence and side pressure might eventually get the insert to let go. We finally \\\"modified\\\" the tool by melting portions of the stop-ball away, making it more functional and much less pretty. Caveat Emptor.\",\"My son loved it, because he much prefers the xbox control layout over the nintendo switch layout.\",\"As soon as i got this product and one half dont work\",\"I could not get the lights to stay in position. I tried tightening them but got no better results. I wanted to aim them where the light would be best for my seedlings and was not satisfied with the results.\",\"The second day (in a row) we used it, didn't hold the air anymore.\",\"Sadly, it was too small.\",\"The quality is very poor and is not 3000PSI Wast of money RIP OFF\",\"I was disappointed that these were a jersey material with a wired bow design not bandana material. They are a little big for my head but they are cute and comfy.\",\"I,ve used Franklin Covey Planners for over 20 years. I have found them extremely helpful in tracking my work-I,m an attorney.

So far Im really satisfied with the purchase. It looks good, feels better, and welcomes my wrist home every day. 10/10 for the money.

Although most people don't know how hard it is to make sense in a really short story the author has it.\",\"My son used this for approx. 5 months and it's got holes on the bottom fabric and sides (in various places). I would not spend $100 on a product that doesn't even last. Disappointed.\",\"I returned to this product\",\"So so pipe, low quality and it hits funny. Wouldn't recommend it.\",\"Great pump but the gauge is waaaaaay off\",\"Love it! Some of the feeling words seem a bit odd but it\\u2019s a fun book!\",\"Simple enough, thin enough... but using the flash sometimes bleeds into the transparent plastic and glares it back into the camera lens... That's the only big problem with this, but in terms of protection? Top notch.\",\"I\\u2019ve only been using it for a week and the silicone is already ripped on the side of some keys.

I wish they'd leave the nuts out. Very dry\",\"My 1st HDMI switch. Tried it and it wouldn't detect that my PS4 Pro was 4K. Later on the HDMI ports stopped working.

Guess I'll be trying a different HDMI switch.\",\"If you are looking for a pillow to help balance your back this is NOT it!\",\"Never could get it to work\",\"These leak. I thought it was me at first, but nope. These definitely leak. The soft ring is in place, the lid is screwed tight, the flip top is secured down. Still leaks. I put my smoothie in a plastic zip bag so it won't get all over, which ends up wasteful.\",\"Great quality but too big\",\"This is what I received. After pulling forever to get it apart it's not what is pictured. It's plastic on plastic. What is pictured is what I need and now it's not eligible to return. Wtf\",\"Not good quality and fit small\",\"Feels pleasant and leaves skin soft, but no visible lifting. Not worth the cost.\",\"These glasses are huge and they don't fit properly.

I had that charger for 4 years. I got this one and it lasted 1 year and it was giving me small problems a 4 months after having it.\",\"Very easy to install. No hassle at all.\",\"I was looking more of a bath pillow...pillow if that makes any sense but, this is not the product for it, I see that many people were happy when I was browsing, but it was for me\",\"Very pretty design. I was looking to replace my cloth placemats because I was honestly tired of washing them! These are VERY thin. I read other reviews that mentioned how thin they were but didn\\u2019t think it would bother me so I ordered them anyway. Well, I\\u2019m not sure I would have ordered them if someone had mentioned that they are paper thin. No joke they might be thinner than paper! But they look pretty and easy to wipe clean so I\\u2019ll see how the durability rates as I put them to use.\",\"Is okay but too hard to get cards out. If you have alot of cards and you push and try to fan them out sometimes cards go flying. would be better without money clip.

You only have to mount the cameras and run the wires (supplied) plug them up and start your settings. I can view my 4 home cameras from ANYWHERE on my cell phone or lap top! It is so cool to be sitting in a restaurant and show a friend a view of your home on your cell phone. The DVR setup is a pain but the cell phone setup is SO easy!! You just scan the bar code symbol and poof, like magic you can see all of your cameras. I give the total package a 9 out of 10.

Their chemistry felt real and compelling. The mystery\\u2019s ending, however, felt abrupt and unresolved.\",\"The taste is strange, Stick with the orange mango\",\"The ball appears to be durable but the pump is tedious. It is a plastic hand pump and it is difficult to pup enough air to make it full and then quickly remove the pump and insert the stopper. An electric pump would be better. Also the ball immediately begins to deflate once the pup is removed. I gave it 3 stars for durability. I have not been able to use it because it is not full of enough air.\",\"It looks nice but it is only facial quality. The rubber tips bend very easily. The wood is cheap wood. And the molly screws broke in my wall and made gigantic holes. So now I have to spackle, paint and redo the whole process which should have been 5 min to do. The molly screws they give are cheap and are WAY too big.

We enjoy free range chicken on the bones so I needed to have shears that can cut through breast bones. These shears have comfortable handles and is very sharp. The shears can also be used to open bottles and can scale fish. I like the fact that the shears can come apart which makes it easy to clean them. The shears come with a magnetic sleeve to hang them on the fridge, but mine was warped so it did not stick on the fridge.\",\"My daughter really likes the design and colors on this product. It\\u2019s easy to hole and drink from. However, it seems to get too much air inside of it- tons of air bubbles. I also don\\u2019t like how water gets trapped between the bottle and the handles.

Set up is crazy easy and our tent was up in seconds compared to our friends who have traditional tents. It is spacious and left plenty of room even after our queen size mattress was in it. The only downside is that if you want any privacy you have to have the fly on because the whole top of the tent is mesh. If your not in some shade, with the fly on its get pretty warm pretty quick when the sun is shining since there aren\\u2019t really windows to unroll and let a breeze through.

Honestly though, I would have liked something simple like a cheap plastic jar tipper...but thought, at the time that more fancy was better. Not necessarily true.

Very much worth trying!\",\"I have a turtle beach headset for my xbox one, so it was a no brainer to get one for my recently purchased PS4. However, I was so dissatisfied over these I had to return them. First off, because I have the PS4 slim, I guess I can't use the optical cord that comes with these. From my understanding (and I'm not tech savvy, just lots of Google), because of this or because it's the slim, I can't control the game and party chat volumes separately. The option is there, just unavailable to me. I could turn the volume all the way up, but it also turned the game volume up and it was still louder than the party. (And yes, I made the setting prioritize party chat above all other sounds). Second, I was unaware the turtle beach symbols on the ear cuffs lit up and blinked blue every couple seconds and there's no way to turn this off. I wasn't too concerned with waking someone up or anything, but I feel like that's the reason for the terrible migraine I got after 20-30 minutes of wear. However, I would like to note that the sound quality was fantastic and my friend said I sounded just fine coming through the mic. So it's not a bad product, just felt like I'd get a brain tumor or something if I kept these. I'll be checking to see if my xbox headset will work instead, or just purchase something else.

Would purchase again.\",\"Not bad! This is the full size duo of The Balm Mad Lash Mascara, but it's $4 less than apparently the exact same product on another product page. This mascara is pretty average, but nothing too special. It works fine as a natural-looking daytime mascara. I like the wand because it's skinny and long, and the formula doesn't clump up on it. The curve doesn't actually do much, but the skinny length allows you to apply mascara with less mess. As far as thickening, curling and lengthening your lashes, this mascara does the bare minimum, particularly in comparison to other mascaras like Benefit's They're Real!, which really volumizes your lashes and stands out. But overall, this isn't a bad mascara at all. It lasts quite a while with limited fallout. It seperates lashes nicely and adds subtle length. This gives you a very natural look, but it's not ideal for those wishing to rock a glam look or for those trying to impress on a date. I also like the ingredients better than the harsh ones in many other mascaras on the market. This is a decent makeup product, but I definitely don't need two. I'm not even sure I need ONE. Oddly, the 1 pack is more expensive than the duo.\",\"I\\u2019d give a review if I could. Package delivered to wrong house!

Each slide has to be inserted into a holder and then inserted in the viewer. We hooked it up to the TV so we could both view the slide without having to look over each others shoulder. That went well, as long you have an extra HDMI port on your TV. The quality color is adequate for most slides, but if the slide has poor exposure, this device will only make it worst.

The ring spindle is quite thin, so the ring falls to the bottom of the tray. I prefer a ring holder with a thicker spindle to keep the ring suspended mid-way. It's easier to put earrings or a necklace in the tray without banging into or getting tangled with my rings. I also didn't realize how challenging it would be to grab silver jewelry from a silver tray. Glass ring holders are easier for this reason.

Even after my trip, I still use these bottles daily and have been doing so for about 6 months. Although, there is a lot I like about these bottles, there are some things I am disappointed by. Positives -attractive design and color - look expensive even though they are great value -secure cap -great size, can fit an ice cube easily through top opening Negatives - they do not keep liquids hot or cold for as long as claimed in the description (5-6 hours max) - not very durable, one bottle dropped on to a tile floor from 5 feet and dented - they tend to fall out of the side mesh water bottle pocket of my backpack (this could be due to the size of the 25 oz bottles)\",\"This is a very short movie, a kind of \\\"Who dunnit?\\\" thriller where women with disabilities are being murdered by a psychotic killer whose identity is revealed at the end. Black and white photography and acting are very good. It's a low budget production and the story takes place inside a house. There are almost no exterior shots, if any. Considering the story being very short, the plot is very simple but despite these constraints, it is still a well constructed film. Blu ray transfer is decent considering the other black and white films from that era. Pros: Good thriller. Cons: Short movie (it feels like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Hour)\",\"Yes yes yes!!!!

There's an elastic band which holds the cover closed or open. The stand is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't 'stand' all that well. The elastic stylus-holder is small and the elastic does not have enough stretch/give, making it frustratingly difficult to insert a stylus.

That being said this book did have a couple of things going for it: military hero, family dynamics, and a whole host of animals (I super love animals in books). So Dani is our heroine and she is beyond likable. She runs a rehab facility for injured vets, and it\\u2019s both massive and top of line. She works her bum off to take care of the people who come to her for help, she lives and breathes this job. She\\u2019s both kind and caring but also patient. A lot of the people who come to her have a lot of anger to work through but she\\u2019s great with everyone. She also has a huge spot of animals, one of the floors of her facility is actual and animal rehab, which helps not just the animals but the people there too. Seriously there really wasn\\u2019t anything I didn\\u2019t like about her. Our hero, Aaron is a little less likable. Obviously he has some anger to work through, not just the injury itself but the betrayal that caused the injury. I gave him some latitude given his situation, but it seems like every time he lashed out it was at Dani, and it just started to make me angry. As for the storyline, it was well written, and I like how much each characters family played a role in the book as well. But the book was just too sweet, that\\u2019s honestly my problem with these sweet/wholesome romances, they just don\\u2019t read as real life at all. Life is hard and messy, and people talk a certain way or act a certain way, especially a house full of recovering vets.

The sliding cover glides smoothly and locks magnetically in place with a satisfying click. Came with a magnetic backing as well as adhesive circles.

But as they day goes on &amp; my feet expand, the strap closest to the front of the shoe starts digging into my pinky toes. Nice neutral color--was not gold bling bling sparkle so it matches well with my summer dresses, cargo pants &amp; jeans. Easy to clean/rinse since I wore them on the beach. I have ankle issues so all of the straps &amp; backing on this shoe provided some support to where my ankle didn't swell to much at the end of the day.\",\"I wanted to keep this swimsuit but it ended up being too small.

Which I was not.\",\"The costume is great! I'm very pleased with what I got. Being an adult M i wasn't sure if i was going to need the next size up in order for it to fit.

I'm not sure how you rate longevity but these will probably last forever! Not that it makes much difference since they don't really do much, unlike the OEM lights that they replaced before one go them blew.

I have pulled off evidence of a many drunk drivers. Once or twice I pulled to show off some other dumb move someone did. However, today, when someone tried their hardest to kill my daughter and I while we were driving back from school, I go to get the footage, despite their being a huge sudden stop that should have triggered the emergency recording, let alone the constant recording it should have been doing, and yet, not a single frame of it was recorded. I have nothing to hand the police about the [censored] person who showed know consideration for the safety of other drivers and came within inches of T boning our car. I gotta say, I've been a pretty staunch Anker fan for years, but this is supremely disappointing. I even mentioned after getting it, \\\"You know, if this thing fails, we're not going to know until we absolutely need it\\\" and I was absolutely right, I just didn't expect that time to come before only having it for maybe a year. EDIT: Anker customer support reached out to me after I posted this review. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. They got me squared away with a solution. I am updating the review with a better star rating, because they did such a great job with customer satisfaction. Their products are extremely reliable, and outside of rare situations like I was presented with, they are definitely the brand to buy.\",\"The band was great until the stitching started to come undone after about 20 days.\",\"Very cute. Quality not the best as the tie began to rip on my second wear. Also it is more robe like as it only ties. Easy to fix with a safety pin.\",\"Out of 12 ornaments 6 were cracked. I guess the 6 functional ones are going to work well for what I need them for haven\\u2019t tried yet. Just opened package.\",\"Some of the reviews mention the kennel only comes with plastic nuts and bolts. The nuts are plastic but the bolts are metallic. The nuts molding quality is not great so the bolt's thread does not engage properly in some of them and they cannot be tightened. They supply about 5 spare nuts and bolts so you eventually find enough pairs that work together to assemble the kennel. It is easy to assemble but I only give it 3 stars because at this price you'd expect higher quality fasteners that work right first time.\",\"Fits more than I expected given the size of the opening. Seems to be good quality and comfortable to wear.\",\"for the price it didnt work very good so i sent it back\",\"The hearts are very small, and the piercing stick is very long if used alone. Hearts hurt me the second day!\",\"I bought this product for when I\\u2019m on vacation and away from home. With it being small it is very discreet and easy to tuck away. The one thing I was not 100% satisfied with was the app. It works decently but I feel it could be more user friendly/easier to use. Every once in a while I struggle to check it while away from home because it isn\\u2019t saved as yours. It is easiest accessed when on the same WiFi network, otherwise you have to put in much information to find your camera. Overall it is a really nice thing to have in my home because it gives me peace of mind.\",\"When the hell did they reverse the order of the pieces? 1 used to be the best now 10 is?? I'm still not used to it!!\",\"I just received this item today. I used it on my computer to see if a mic in a headset would work this this sort of item. It did, but the connector has to jiggled to get the sound to go to both speakers. I moved it to the other computer and the jacks still had to be wiggled around to get them to work. I need this item for upcoming events and if after this week the problem persist or gets worse I will have to return the item ASAP.

I found this product while searching for solutions to have my dogs urine be less concentrated. I have a Bernedoodle who weighs 95 lbs. His recommended dosage was 5 tablets. There was no way I was going to give him 5 tablets to start with. I gave him 2 tablets on the first day and the second day gave him 3. On the 3rd day he started to vomit bile and it was uncontrollable. He is healthy as can be. He is 1.5 years old and we took him to our vet and they suggested that we stop giving him these tablets as it was the only new thing introduced to his diet. He lost his appetite the 4th day but continued to drink water. Sure enough the next day he was back to normal after stopping these tablets for two days. Stay away!\",\"Would be ok but the fabric happens to attract every bit of animal hair from my dog and cat.

In terms of fragrance mentioned by other reviewers, I agree there's a grandma-esque smell, but it doesn't bother me. Being a mineral sunscreen, the product is difficult to remove with just water. I recommend using an oil cleanser first and then a light foam/gel cleanser after that to fully remove the sunscreen. I have sensitive skin, but I've had no negative reaction to the product whatsoever! I'm very satisfied with this purchase and look forward to repurchasing it in the future.\",\"This top is so beautiful but the fit is way too small. I'm a size 4-6 and the L I ordered fits like a small. I was going to return it but it's too pretty lol.\",\"..fine to use for light snacks\",\"The quality of this product was not what I expected for the price I paid. Sure, it comes with lots of little gadgets but they are for pretend only - none of them are sturdy enough for actual usage outside.

You do have to replace either option fairly quickly to keep the temperature cool. However I completed the 2 week recommended care but by \\u201cclean out\\u201d they really mean that you have to basically take apart the entire product (10+ screws) to get a thorough cleaning in. I\\u2019ve had this product for about 3 months and even with the completion of the routine care, it still stopped working! Unlike many amazon products- the return or exchange policy is very short- 1 month. 1 month of owning the product is not enough time to fully allow the cooler to run and determine the quality of it! I recommend not purchasing this product and spending a few more bucks on a quality brand!! Very disappointed for the amount of money I spent!\"],\"topic\":[\"25: phone thing years home stay friend find\",\"0: case small love feels design bit camera\",\"3: 2 3 5 stars 1 4 weeks\",\"3: 2 3 5
